  ## What's Verify Bot?

  Verify Bot is a simple to configure bot that helps Spigot/BuiltByBit plugin developers verify their plugin's purchases through PayPal's API. This allows developers to easily provide support for verified plugin buyers.

  As a bonus, this plugin is also a framework for creating Discord bots. You can easily add additional slashcommands by duplicating either the about or verify command and making changes.
